# General
- You do not need to run migrations before testing. Migrations are ran automatically against the test database due to Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase::class in Pest.php


# Unit Tests

- Unit tests (located in the tests/Unit folder) should not require the laravel app to run. 
- These tests should not involve communications with the database. 

- For example, testing a helper function that multiplies 2 numbers can be a unit test. 


# Feature Tests

- Feature Tests (located in the tests/Feature folder) can involve communication to the Database. 
- If you want to write tests for a specific model, you can add it to the tests/Feature/Models folder.
